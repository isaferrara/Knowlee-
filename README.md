# Knowlee2.0

"We believe knowledge is for everyone, and everyone has knowledge to share"

Knowlee is a social network that was created form the basic idea that there should be a free platform that allows "learners" to create sudy paths and roadmaps, 
obtain knowledge from other users and build their own profile and content to share. 
<br/>
While Knowlee 1.0 was a collaboration from people around the world, Knowlee 2.0 is an individual project that aproaches the same concepts but adds more features to
that make it more user friendly and help the "learner" build a community. Knowlee 2.0 also improves the design and structure to follow current trends.
